# MonitorPal Refactoring Summary

## Project Overview

MonitorPal is a desktop application designed to help traders manage risk by monitoring profit/loss values across trading platforms like Quantower, NinjaTrader, TradingView, and Tradovate. The application detects trading platform windows, monitors P&L values using OCR, and triggers a lockout sequence when losses exceed thresholds.

## Architectural Foundation

The application follows a clean architecture approach with distinct layers:

- **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic interfaces, models, and error handling patterns
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Provides concrete implementations for services
- **Presentation Layer**: PySide6-based UI components
- **Application Layer**: Dependency injection container and initialization

## Refactoring Accomplished

We've successfully implemented the following refactoring:

1. **Qt-native Screenshot Implementation**
   - Replaced PyAutoGUI with Qt's native screenshot capabilities
   - Created `QtScreenshotService` in the infrastructure layer
   - Fixed QPixmap to PIL Image conversion using an intermediate buffer approach

2. **Qt-based Region Selection**
   - Implemented a Qt-native region selector
   - Created `qt_region_selector.py` with `select_region_qt` function

3. **Dependency Injection Updates**
   - Updated the container in `app.py` to register the new screenshot service

## Current State and Challenges

The refactoring is partially complete with some remaining issues:

1. **Core Functionality**
   - Screenshot capture is working correctly: images are being captured
   - OCR text extraction is functioning: text is being extracted from screenshots
   - Region selection is working: users can select regions on screen

2. **UI Issues**
   - In the test app, the captured screenshots aren't displaying in preview areas
   - The issue appears to be related to UI updating, not the screenshot service itself
   - All necessary data is available, but UI components aren't displaying it correctly

3. **Architecture Status**
   - Clean architecture maintained with proper layer separation
   - Fixed `qpixmap_to_pil` conversion to work reliably
   - Removed duplicate files to maintain clean organization

## Files Added/Modified

1. **New Files**:
   - `src/infrastructure/platform/qt_screenshot_service.py`: Qt-native screenshot service
   - `src/presentation/components/qt_region_selector.py`: Qt-based region selection UI

2. **Modified Files**:
   - `app.py`: Updated to use the new screenshot service
   - `test_app.py`: Updated to use the new region selector

3. **Deleted Files**:
   - Removed duplicate screenshot service in incorrect location
   - Will replace the old PyAutoGUI-based screenshot service once testing is complete

## Next Steps

To fully complete the refactoring:

1. Resolve the UI update issues in the test app
2. Confirm all thread-safety aspects work correctly
3. Apply consistent use of `Qt.QueuedConnection` for cross-thread signals
4. Test all scenarios thoroughly
5. Once confirmed working, remove the old PyAutoGUI-based implementation
6. Update documentation

The core architectural refactoring is complete but still requires UI-level adjustments before we can fully replace the old implementation.
